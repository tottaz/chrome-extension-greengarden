This is a free, open-source, sample application demonstrating use of the
Greengarden API. It takes the form of a Chrome Extension that, when installed,
integrates Greengarden into your web experience in the following ways:

  * Creates a button in your button-bar which, when clicked, pops up a
    QuickAdd window to create a new news item associated with the current web page.

  * Installs the special Greengarden TAB+Q keyboard shortcut. When this key combo
    is pressed from any web page, it brings up the same popup.

To install:

  1. Download the code, e.g. `git clone git://github.com/greengarden/Chrome-Extension-Greengarden.git`
  2. Navigate chrome to `chrome://extensions`
  3. Check the `Developer mode` toggle
  4. Click on `Load Unpacked Extension...`
  5. Select the folder containing the extension
